# Detecting-AI-generated-product-reviews-in-Dravidian-languages
In this research, I applied XLM-RoBERTa, MuRIL, ALBERT, and mBERT to detect AI-generated product reviews in Dravidian languages. The models were fine-tuned to classify human-written and AI-generated reviews, leveraging transformer-based architectures for robust text representation.
